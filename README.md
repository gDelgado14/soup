Making sense of spaghetti xml ...

I'm looking to switch to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) from Wordpress and thought this would be a great learning opportunity to parse XML ...
Thankfully there's already some code written that does the parsing for you but I thought I'd venture on my own in terms of turning the pages
into Jekyll acceptable html.

### Completed:

- This code can now parse the blog content and save it into your _posts directory (or _drafts if you have draft posts in Wordpress)
- Handles none-posts (i.e. About page, etc)
- downloads images and saves to downloads directory

Making sense of spaghetti xml ...

### Under Development

I'm looking to switch to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) from Wordpress and thought this would be a great learning opportunity to parse XML ...
Thankfully there's already some code written that does the parsing for you but I thought i'd venture on my own in terms of turning the pages
into Jekyll acceptable html.
